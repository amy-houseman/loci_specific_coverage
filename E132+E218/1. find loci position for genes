Go to https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables

On 'table' choose NCBI refseq

##Whole genome coordinates:

For whole genome version coordinates, use region: genomic.
Output format as BED and change the output file name. 
Find the refseq ID in the file, for APC this is NM_000038.6.
Click next, then choose whole gene. 

You will then see its coordinates like this (first three columns):

chr5	112737884	112846239	NM_000038.6

##Exon coordinates (+20 bases at each end)
For whole genome version coordinates, use region: genomic.
Output format as BED and change the output file name. 
Find the refseq ID in the file, for APC this is NM_000038.6.
Click next, then choose Exons plus 20 bases at each end.
